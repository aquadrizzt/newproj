Miscellaneous other ideas
- Because of the new Assassination mechanic, a role being present on Evil can't prevent it from being on Good. 
- Evil might not have enough to coordinate -> maybe tell them Evil team roles or Evil team modifiers.

- Role that is given information in the form of puzzles (the Lovers are sitting 3 seats apart, Lancelot is between them)
- Role that knows information about the people adjacent to them 
- Positional infomation
- Modifier information
